# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-SVM-and-NB-
This project performs sentiment classification on Amazon reviews from the Cell Phones & Accessories category. Using NLP preprocessing, TF-IDF, POS tagging, and lexicon-based features, two machine learning models—Multinomial Naïve Bayes and Linear SVC—are trained to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. An interactive Power BI dashboard is also developed to visualize customer insights and sentiment trends.

# 🚀 Project Objectives
1. Analyze Amazon review patterns using NLP techniques
2. Build and compare machine learning models for sentiment classification
3. Visualize insights using an interactive Power BI dashboard
